# Level - 1

In this Level you will find all the Basic of Python.

### Projects
---
You have an example of Project.
<br>
This Project is not complete but you have Some Lines of Code.
<br>
<br>
So you can try to do the same thing for one of your Project (Game: Chess, ...).
<br>
Even you do not know how to do completely, the most important you have Some Lines of Code to Find the Good Way. 
<br>
Just use comments to replace after with Lines of Code.
